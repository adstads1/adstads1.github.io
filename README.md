# First ever website!
---
This was the first ever website that I've created in my life back in 2016. 

The website is a very basic portfolio website with basic elements.

----

This project solified my knowledge of:
* The general concept of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
* The use of IDE's and extensions
* OOP fundamentals
* Basic UI protocols
* Comments in HTML, CSS and JavaScript



#### *A new portfolio website is currently being in production and will be published live, June 2019.*

Feel free to use my work and code.
