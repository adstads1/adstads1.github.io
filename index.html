           <div class="imagedes">What I've used to create and edit the image above was a graphical image software called Adobe Photoshop. Adobe Photoshop is Bitmap graphical softwares which can be used to create or edit images. I recommend to use Adobe Photoshop due to the variety of tools available to edit/create images. However, the negative aspect of Photoshop is that it requires users to pay (unlike pixlr) and can be hard for beginners to learn on how to use the software. I created this image by creating an image of a horse by using a pencil. I then used the PolygonalLasso Tool to create the Poly effect and made each triangle on the background have its own colour creating a black/purple/green and blue effect. I created a star which I then copied and pasted two times and grouped them.The file format I used for this picture is a .png. I used this format as the resolution of the image is higher conpared to a .jpeg format which I could of chosen and the .png format stores a high image quality compared to most Bitmap formats.The image resolution is 243x215px causing the image quality to be low and this causes the image to take up less disk storage. The Lossless compression was used for this file format, which is an advantage because the image quality hasn't decreased. Also the image depth is 32 bit causing the file size to be large (taking up more disk space) however, this causes the image quality to be high and a variety of colours to be displayed. However as the image resolution is low and the poly affect of the image reduces the file size this generally means the image quality doesn't take up a lot of memory of 72kb. The Copyright law determines how the material created by the owner can be used and users can identify the owner by looking at the contact details of where the image was originated. For other users to be able to use the owners material, they will need to contact the owner and grant permission. This prcess is done because the creater of an iage would of taken time and money to create an image/material and would need asked for this matter. Copyright free allows users to use the material without asking the owner and can be found where stated. </div>

           <div class="Adamdesc">What I've used to edit the image above was a website called Pixlr. Pixlr is a photo editors website with features and tools available similar to Bitmap graphical softwares. I recommend to use Pixlr due to the tools available to edit/create images with no payments required. However, the negative aspect of Pixlr, is even though it has many features, compared to graphical softwares such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Anime, it lakcs with some features which are available in Photoshop and some many features on Photoshop are not in Pixelr due to Pixelr being a free photo editor. The tools I used in Pixlr to edit the image above was the crop tool (grouped then cutted the ungrouped area of the image), erase tool, colour picker tool. I captured the image by using the Camera on my mobile phone. I then used a USB which was connected to my phone to a P.C which I then copied and pasted the image to the P.C. The file format I used for this picture is a .png. I used this format as the resolution of the image is higher conpared to a .jpeg format which I could of chosen and the .png format stores a high image quality compared to most Bitmap formats.The image resolution is 1944x2855px causing the image quality to be high however, this causes the image to take up more disk storage.
